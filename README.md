Before you can use Rfacebook package to analyze data, you need to follow the steps below:

 - Go to Tools and Support menu -> Access Token tools and generate Access token
 - make sure to click debug button and extend access token, this will allow you to use the token for 3 months
You are ready to analyze facebook with R. Please note that according to FacebookÂ´s new API policies the information you can get is very limited compared to the amount you were able to download with apps using API 1.
Download the R script and change the access token and run in R-Studio on your laptop.
